-- This Lua script defines a module which can be imported in any Lua script using:
-- local junglestory = require('junglestory')
-- You can then call any function on the module, e.g. junglestory.start()
-- In FungusLua, module files must be contained in a Resources/Lua folder somewhere in your project.

-- Lua modules are typically declared using an empty table called M.
-- All members of the module must have the M. prefix, and the M table is returned at the end of the script.
-- N.B. If you want to reference another function in the module, you must use the M.prefix.

M = {}

function M.start()
	runblock(flowchart, "Intro") -- Runs the Intro Block on the flowchart

	setcharacter(sherlockcharacter, "annoyed") -- Sets the speaking character and portrait
	say "Hello John."

	setcharacter(johncharacter, "eyeroll")
	say "Hello Sherlock."
	say "We appear to be in a tropical rain forest."
	wait(1)
	say "Again."

	runblock(flowchart, "ZoomIn", 0, true) -- Runs the ZoomIn Block, but doesn't wait for it to finish

	say "While we're here, I suggest we fill our canteens from this waterfall."

	menu("Agreed", M.canteenyes) -- Show menu option, call M.canteenyes() if selected
	menu("No, we don't have time", M.canteenno)
end

function M.canteenyes()
	runblock(flowchart, "PlayPourSound")
	setcharacter(sherlockcharacter, "annoyed")
	say "There, that's better"

	M.moveon() -- Call another function in the module
end

function M.canteenno()
	setcharacter(sherlockcharacter, "annoyed")
	say "Let's get moving"
	
	M.moveon()
end

function M.moveon()
	setcharacter(sherlockcharacter, "annoyed")
	say("There must be some way out of this cursed place.")
end

return M
